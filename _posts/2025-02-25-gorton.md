excerpt: "A more accurate way to depict the communication process is through the Interaction Model of Communication (see below). The model adds the concepts of encoding and decoding. When one is considered the "encoder," they transform a message into signs and symbols. A decoder is the recipient of the message. They are trying to interpret the encoder's message and make meaning from it. Notice how the model depicts communication as a cyclical process."
