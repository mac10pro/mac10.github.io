I've used a fair number of emotionally charged words above that might be
triggering your FUD detectors right about now. But be advised: it's not paranoia
when they really are out to get you. If recent, extremely high profile (and
subsequently weaponized) breaches like those of the Clinton Campaign and the DNC
aren't enough to make you want to air gap your entire life, then I envy your
steely-eyed mettle and implore you to teach me your meditation techniques.
