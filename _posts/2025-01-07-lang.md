Interaction Model of Communication

A more accurate way to depict the communication process is through the Interaction Model of Communication (see below). The model adds the concepts of encoding and decoding. When one is considered the "encoder," they transform a message into signs and symbols. A decoder is the recipient of the message. They are trying to interpret the encoder's message and make meaning from it. Notice how the model depicts communication as a cyclical process.

# Assumptions About Encoding & Decoding
Encoding and decoding takes place in one's own experience. Depending on our own realities and cultures, we may interpret messages differently.
No meaningful communication can occur unless interpreters share a common set of experiences. For example, if two communicators do not share the same language, messages cannot be meaningfully exchanged.
No two communicators are 100% alike. This means that negotiation of meaning will always occur.
